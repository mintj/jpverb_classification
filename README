i. below dirs contain test codes for various conditions

(rootdir)
|-- nomial
|-- last2
|-- last2_trans
|-- head
|-- head_wo_len
|-- random




ii. in each dir, one may find those files:

(rootdir)
|--(workdir)
       |-- tmva.cpp     # containing training and testing for Likelihood/KNN/MLP/BDT
       |-- dnn.cpp      # containing training and testing for DNN
       |-- get_cut.cpp  # this macro will find the best working point for each algorithm according to a certain criterion
       |-- app.cpp      # apply training result to a test sample (100K+100K) and the sample of REAL japanese verbs (323+177)

workflow:
  root -l tmva.cpp
  root -l dnn.cpp
  root -l get_cut.cpp
  root -l app.cpp




iii. after having all conditions be studied, go back to (rootdir), run the "draw_comparison.cpp" macro to get plots for performance
